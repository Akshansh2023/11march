    "In hypothesis testing, a one-tailed test and a two-tailed test refer to the directionality of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis states the direction of the effect, either an increase or a decrease in a particular outcome variable. In other words, it only considers one direction of change. The null hypothesis represents the opposite direction. For example, we might conduct a one-tailed test to determine if a new drug increases the average response time of participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a two-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect. It considers two directions of change, either an increase or a decrease in a particular outcome variable. The null hypothesis in this case is that there is no effect. For example, we might conduct a two-tailed test to determine if a new drug affects the average response time of participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of one-tailed or two-tailed test depends on the research question and the nature of the hypothesis. One-tailed tests are used when we have a specific directional hypothesis and want to test if the effect is in that specific direction. Two-tailed tests are used when the hypothesis does not specify the direction of the effect or when there is no prior knowledge about the direction of the effect.\n",

    "Suppose that you want to test for a rare genetic disorder in a population. The prevalence of the disorder is 1 in 10,000, meaning that the prior probability of someone having the disorder is 0.0001.
